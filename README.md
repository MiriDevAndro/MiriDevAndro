WORK
EXPERIENCE Android Developer 2015 — 2021
Information Technology
I as IT have experience in Hardware and Software.
Now my job as a self-employed person is focused on developing applications for
smartphone, mostly
on android devices.
The programming language I use the most is JAVA, except in java I can work
no problem even in languages
other as:
• JS
• PHP
• HTML
• C#
etc ... so the set that an application needs ,and debug any
kind of language.
I have experience in sending Client / SERVER requests:
• REST
• SOAP
etc...
I understand very well how HEADERS is built when the client sends a request to the
server.
For DATA transport:
• JSON
• XML
• DB SQL
Another skill I have is REVERSE ENGINEER meaning, I read very well
BYTECODE and assembly less.
DEOBFUSCATOR is also included in the ENGINEER REVERSE, ie code conversion
understandably.
